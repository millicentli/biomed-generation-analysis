The exclusion criteria were the open EVD insertion and\/or a pre-existing infectious disease of the central nervous system.\n\nRESULTS\nTwo hundred consecutive patients were enrolled. Of these, 100 patients were treated by using metal EVD (group 1) and 100 patients with polyurethane catheters (group 2). The overall complication rate was 26% (misplacement 13.5%, hemorrhage 12.5%, infection 2.5%, and dislocation 1%) without statistically significant differences between both groups.

There were 15 serious adverse events, none considered related to immunisation.","abstract":"BACKGROUND\nGiven the importance of flexible use of different COVID-19 vaccines within the same schedule to facilitate rapid deployment, we studied mixed priming schedules incorporating an adenoviral-vectored vaccine (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 [ChAd], AstraZeneca), two mRNA vaccines (BNT162b2 [BNT], Pfizer-BioNTech, and mRNA-1273 [m1273], Moderna) and a nanoparticle vaccine containing SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein and Matrix-M adjuvant (NVX-CoV2373 [NVX], Novavax).\n\nMETHODS\nCom-COV2 is a single-blind, randomised, non-inferiority trial in which adults aged 50 years and older, previously immunised with a single dose of ChAd or BNT in the community, were randomly assigned (in random blocks of three and six) within these cohorts in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive a second dose intramuscularly (8-12 weeks after the first dose) with the homologous vaccine, m1273, or NVX. The primary endpoint was the geometric mean ratio (GMR) of serum SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgG concentrations measured by ELISA in heterologous versus homologous schedules at 28 days after the second dose, with a non-inferiority criterion of the GMR above 0·63 for the one-sided 98·75% CI. The primary analysis was on the per-protocol population, who were seronegative at baseline. Safety analyses were done for all participants who received a dose of study vaccine. The trial is registered with ISRCTN, number 27841311.\n\nFINDINGS\nBetween April 19 and May 14, 2021, 1072 participants were enrolled at a median of 9·4 weeks after receipt of a single dose of ChAd (n=540, 47% female) or BNT (n=532, 40% female). In ChAd-primed participants, geometric mean concentration (GMC) 28 days after a boost of SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgG in recipients of ChAd\/m1273 (20 114 ELISA laboratory units [ELU]\/mL [95% CI 18 160 to 22 279]) and ChAd\/NVX (5597 ELU\/mL [4756 to 6586]) was non-inferior to that of ChAd\/ChAd recipients (1971 ELU\/mL [1718 to 2262]) with a GMR of 10·2 (one-sided 98·75% CI 8·4 to ∞) for ChAd\/m1273 and 2·8 (2·2 to ∞) for ChAd\/NVX, compared with ChAd\/ChAd. In BNT-primed participants, non-inferiority was shown for BNT\/m1273 (GMC 22 978 ELU\/mL [95% CI 20 597 to 25 636]) but not for BNT\/NVX (8874 ELU\/mL [7391 to 10 654]), compared with BNT\/BNT (16 929 ELU\/mL [15 025 to 19 075]) with a GMR of 1·3 (one-sided 98·75% CI 1·1 to ∞) for BNT\/m1273 and 0·5 (0·4 to ∞) for BNT\/NVX, compared with BNT\/BNT; however, NVX still induced an 18-fold rise in GMC 28 days after vaccination. There were 15 serious adverse events, none considered related to immunisation.\n\nINTERPRETATION\nHeterologous second dosing with m1273, but not NVX, increased transient systemic reactogenicity compared with homologous schedules. Multiple vaccines are appropriate to complete primary immunisation following priming with BNT or ChAd, facilitating rapid vaccine deployment globally and supporting recognition of such schedules for vaccine certification.\n\nFUNDING\nUK Vaccine Task Force, Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), and National Institute for Health Research. NVX vaccine was supplied for use in the trial by Novavax.\n","plain_summary":"The study found that it is safe to use different types of vaccines to complete a person's primary immunization, after they have received their first dose of either the ChAd or BNT vaccine.

As part of a pilot study we assessed uptake and maintenance of cup use among young school girls in Kenya.\n\nMETHODS\nA total of 192 girls between 14 to 16 years were enrolled in 10 schools in Nyanza Province, Western Kenya; these schools were assigned menstrual cups as part of the cluster-randomized pilot study. Girls were provided with menstrual cups in addition to training and guidance on use, puberty education, and instructions for menstrual hygiene. During repeated individual visits with nurses, girls reported use of the menstrual cup and nurses recorded colour change of the cup.\n\nRESULTS\nGirls were able to keep their cups in good condition, with only 12 cups (6.3%) lost (dropped in toilet, lost or destroyed). Verbally reported cup use increased from 84% in the first 3 months (n = 143) to 96% after 9 months (n = 74). Colour change of the cup, as 'uptake' indicator of use, was detected in 70.8% of 192 participants, with a median time of 5 months (range 1-14 months). Uptake differed by school and was significantly higher among girls who experienced menarche within the past year (adjusted risk ratio 1.29, 95% CI 1.04-1.60), and was faster among girls enrolled in the second study year (hazard ratio 3.93, 95% CI 2.09-7.38).

Eligible clinics had at least 20 patients with SMI; clinicians and their adult patients with SMI with at least 1 modifiable CV risk factor not at the goal set by the American College of Cardiology\/American Heart Association guidelines were included. Statistical analysis was conducted on an intention-to-treat basis from January 10, 2019, to December 29, 2021.\nIntervention\nThe CDS system assessed modifiable CV risk factors and provided personalized treatment recommendations to clinicians and patients.\nMain Outcomes and Measures\nPatient-level change in total modifiable CV risk over 12 months, summed from individual modifiable risk factors (smoking, body mass index, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, systolic blood pressure, and hemoglobin A1c level).\nResults\nA total of 80 clinics were randomized; 4 clinics were excluded for having fewer than 20 eligible patients, leaving 42 intervention clinics and 34 control clinics.

When examined by season and month, the data indicated that investigator-reported respiratory infections and anti-infective medication use were less frequent in dupilumab- versus placebo-treated patients throughout the calendar year.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nDupilumab treatment was associated with a reduced incidence of investigator-reported respiratory infections in patients with moderate-to-severe asthma or severe CRSwNP. Further studies are required to determine the mechanism behind this reduction.\n","plain_summary":"Dupilumab is a medication that helps reduce inflammation in people with asthma or sinus problems. This study found that people who took dupilumab had fewer respiratory infections than people who did not take the medication."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-11-21T16:42:08.099616Z","updated_at":"2022-11-28T13:12:39.653283Z","inner_id":2,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":4,"updated_by":19,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":4812,"annotations":[{"id":87,"completed_by":19,"result":[{"id":"V8QpEJxulI","type":"choices","value":{"choices":["Strongly agree"]},"origin":"manual","to_name":"summary","from_name":"containsKeyResult"},{"id":"kn3w3oB5Q8","type":"choices","value":{"choices":["The population is mentioned, and described accurately"]},"origin":"manual","to_name":"summary","from_name":"population"},{"id":"sgfP1Qe3nW","type":"choices","value":{"choices":["The intervention is mentioned, and described accurately"]},"origin":"manual","to_name":"summary","from_name":"intervention"},{"id":"QJj98DuksQ","type":"choices","value":{"choices":["The outcome is mentioned, and described accurately"]},"origin":"manual","to_name":"summary","from_name":"outcome"},{"id":"RJTs4F-jBZ","type":"choices","value":{"choices":["No ommision"]},"origin":"manual","to_name":"summary","from_name":"omissions"},{"id":"i2iDiXljD4","type":"choices","value":{"choices":["No errors"]},"origin":"manual","to_name":"summary","from_name":"errors"},{"id":"lFyrNdOzEX","type":"choices","value":{"choices":["Strongly agree"]},"origin":"manual","to_name":"summary","from_name":"coherence"},{"id":"6O3a6Ca3EQ","type":"choices","value":{"choices":["Strongly agree"]},"origin":"manual","to_name":"summary","from_name":"usefulness"},{"id":"pVcrfCyoHR","type":"choices","value":{"choices":["Agree"]},"origin":"manual","to_name":"summary","from_name":"containsKeyResult_plain"},{"id":"qP4tljgtt7","type":"choices","value":{"choices":["The population is not mentioned (missing) in the simplified model text"]},"origin":"manual","to_name":"summary_plain","from_name":"population_plain"},{"id":"VVAyOwmTYf","type":"choices","value":{"choices":["The intervention is mentioned, but somewhat underspecified"]},"origin":"manual","to_name":"summary_plain","from_name":"intervention_plain"},{"id":"nSS6cIj3sj","type":"choices","value":{"choices":["The outcome is mentioned, but somewhat underspecified"]},"origin":"manual","to_name":"summary_plain","from_name":"outcome_plain"},{"id":"IxCi4FoEA1","type":"choices","value":{"choices":["Major omission(s)"]},"origin":"manual","to_name":"summary","from_name":"omissions_plain"},{"id":"e3Snp_57s5","type":"choices","value":{"choices":["No errors"]},"origin":"manual","to_name":"summary","from_name":"errors_plain"},{"id":"mdW2xBdeYo","type":"choices","value":{"choices":["Strongly agree"]},"origin":"manual","to_name":"summary_plain","from_name":"coherence_plain"},{"id":"ZhZQtvUblF","type":"choices","value":{"choices":["Strongly agree"]},"origin":"manual","to_name":"summary_plain","from_name":"readability_plain"},{"id":"8fS8ONfCL2","type":"choices","value":{"choices":["Mostly all"]},"origin":"manual","to_name":"summary_plain","from_name":"substitution_plain"},{"id":"b54ZFfQlPW","type":"choices","value":{"choices":["Agree"]},"origin":"manual","to_name":"summary_plain","from_name":"usefulness_plain"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2022-11-28T13:07:34.921722Z","updated_at":"2022-11-28T13:07:34.921736Z","lead_time":133.272,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":4812,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"7cae930a-out_RCT.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"text":"There was a notable reduction in transmission of the virus among the household close contacts in the treatment group (4%) vs. 76% in the placebo group.","doc_idx":10,"summary":"The above study looks at the effects of a compound of povidone-iodine and glycyrrhizic acid on the laboratory and clinical recovery from SARS-CoV-2 patients and their household contacts.

Effective broad-spectrum antiviral therapy is urgently needed for the control of early SARS-CoV-2 infection to limit its spread and mutations. In this randomized placebo-controlled clinical study, we tested the effects of intranasal and oropharyngeal delivery of a compound of povidone-iodine 0.5% and glycyrrhizic acid 2.5 mg\/ml on the laboratory (PCR) and clinical recovery from SARS-CoV-2 patients and their household contacts. 353 patients suspected of having COVID-19 infection were screened by chest CT and nasopharyngeal swab tests (PCR). 200 patients were randomly allocated to two equal groups: treatment and placebo groups. Treatment accelerated the recovery of PCR on days 4, 7, and 10, as evidenced by PCR-positive patients (70, vs. 99%, 20 vs. 65%, 1 vs. 10%) in both the treated and placebo groups, respectively. Treatment enhanced the early recovery of symptoms [day 7.6 ± 2 (CI 7:8.3) vs. 8.9 ± 2 (CI 8.3:9.6)]. Treatment promoted early recovery of anosmia and ageusia [5.6 ± 1 (CI, 4.8:6.4) vs. 11 ± 3 days, (CI, 10.8:12)] in both the treated and control groups ( P  < 0.0001). There was a notable reduction in transmission of the virus among the household close contacts in the treatment group (4%) vs. 76% in the placebo group.
