Effective broad-spectrum antiviral therapy is urgently needed for the control of early SARS-CoV-2 infection to limit its spread and mutations. In this randomized placebo-controlled clinical study, we tested the effects of intranasal and oropharyngeal delivery of a compound of povidone-iodine 0.5% and glycyrrhizic acid 2.5 mg\/ml on the laboratory (PCR) and clinical recovery from SARS-CoV-2 patients and their household contacts. 353 patients suspected of having COVID-19 infection were screened by chest CT and nasopharyngeal swab tests (PCR). 200 patients were randomly allocated to two equal groups: treatment and placebo groups. Treatment accelerated the recovery of PCR on days 4, 7, and 10, as evidenced by PCR-positive patients (70, vs. 99%, 20 vs. 65%, 1 vs. 10%) in both the treated and placebo groups, respectively. Treatment enhanced the early recovery of symptoms [day 7.6 ± 2 (CI 7:8.3) vs. 8.9 ± 2 (CI 8.3:9.6)]. Treatment promoted early recovery of anosmia and ageusia [5.6 ± 1 (CI, 4.8:6.4) vs. 11 ± 3 days, (CI, 10.8:12)] in both the treated and control groups ( P  < 0.0001).

The primary endpoint was the geometric mean ratio (GMR) of serum SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgG concentrations measured by ELISA in heterologous versus homologous schedules at 28 days after the second dose, with a non-inferiority criterion of the GMR above 0·63 for the one-sided 98·75% CI. The primary analysis was on the per-protocol population, who were seronegative at baseline. Safety analyses were done for all participants who received a dose of study vaccine. The trial is registered with ISRCTN, number 27841311.\n\nFINDINGS\nBetween April 19 and May 14, 2021, 1072 participants were enrolled at a median of 9·4 weeks after receipt of a single dose of ChAd (n=540, 47% female) or BNT (n=532, 40% female). In ChAd-primed participants, geometric mean concentration (GMC) 28 days after a boost of SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgG in recipients of ChAd\/m1273 (20 114 ELISA laboratory units [ELU]\/mL [95% CI 18 160 to 22 279]) and ChAd\/NVX (5597 ELU\/mL [4756 to 6586]) was non-inferior to that of ChAd\/ChAd recipients (1971 ELU\/mL [1718 to 2262]) with a GMR of 10·2 (one-sided 98·75% CI 8·4 to ∞) for ChAd\/m1273 and 2·8 (2·2 to ∞) for ChAd\/NVX, compared with ChAd\/ChAd. In BNT-primed participants, non-inferiority was shown for BNT\/m1273 (GMC 22 978 ELU\/mL [95% CI 20 597 to 25 636]) but not for BNT\/NVX (8874 ELU\/mL [7391 to 10 654]), compared with BNT\/BNT (16 929 ELU\/mL [15 025 to 19 075]) with a GMR of 1·3 (one-sided 98·75% CI 1·1 to ∞) for BNT\/m1273 and 0·5 (0·4 to ∞) for BNT\/NVX, compared with BNT\/BNT; however, NVX still induced an 18-fold rise in GMC 28 days after vaccination. There were 15 serious adverse events, none considered related to immunisation.\n\nINTERPRETATION\nHeterologous second dosing with m1273, but not NVX, increased transient systemic reactogenicity compared with homologous schedules. Multiple vaccines are appropriate to complete primary immunisation following priming with BNT or ChAd, facilitating rapid vaccine deployment globally and supporting recognition of such schedules for vaccine certification.\n\nFUNDING\nUK Vaccine Task Force, Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), and National Institute for Health Research. NVX vaccine was supplied for use in the trial by Novavax.\n","plain_summary":"The study found that it is safe to use different types of vaccines to complete a person's primary immunization, after they have received their first dose of either the ChAd or BNT vaccine.

As part of a pilot study we assessed uptake and maintenance of cup use among young school girls in Kenya.\n\nMETHODS\nA total of 192 girls between 14 to 16 years were enrolled in 10 schools in Nyanza Province, Western Kenya; these schools were assigned menstrual cups as part of the cluster-randomized pilot study. Girls were provided with menstrual cups in addition to training and guidance on use, puberty education, and instructions for menstrual hygiene. During repeated individual visits with nurses, girls reported use of the menstrual cup and nurses recorded colour change of the cup.\n\nRESULTS\nGirls were able to keep their cups in good condition, with only 12 cups (6.3%) lost (dropped in toilet, lost or destroyed). Verbally reported cup use increased from 84% in the first 3 months (n = 143) to 96% after 9 months (n = 74). Colour change of the cup, as 'uptake' indicator of use, was detected in 70.8% of 192 participants, with a median time of 5 months (range 1-14 months). Uptake differed by school and was significantly higher among girls who experienced menarche within the past year (adjusted risk ratio 1.29, 95% CI 1.04-1.60), and was faster among girls enrolled in the second study year (hazard ratio 3.93, 95% CI 2.09-7.38).

Eligible clinics had at least 20 patients with SMI; clinicians and their adult patients with SMI with at least 1 modifiable CV risk factor not at the goal set by the American College of Cardiology\/American Heart Association guidelines were included. Statistical analysis was conducted on an intention-to-treat basis from January 10, 2019, to December 29, 2021.\nIntervention\nThe CDS system assessed modifiable CV risk factors and provided personalized treatment recommendations to clinicians and patients.\nMain Outcomes and Measures\nPatient-level change in total modifiable CV risk over 12 months, summed from individual modifiable risk factors (smoking, body mass index, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, systolic blood pressure, and hemoglobin A1c level).\nResults\nA total of 80 clinics were randomized; 4 clinics were excluded for having fewer than 20 eligible patients, leaving 42 intervention clinics and 34 control clinics. A total of 8937 patients with SMI (4922 women [55.1%]; mean [SD] age, 48.4 [13.5] years) were enrolled. There was a 4% lower rate of increase in total modifiable CV risk among intervention patients relative to control patients (relative rate ratio [RR], 0.96; 95% CI, 0.94-0.98). The intervention favored patients who were 18 to 29 years of age (RR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.81-0.98) or 50 to 59 years of age (RR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.90-0.96), Black (RR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.88-0.98), or White (RR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.94-0.98).

Reported upper and lower respiratory tract infection events were numerically or significantly lower in dupilumab-treated patients in both conditions, as were the number of patients experiencing investigator-reported infections. Significantly less systemic anti-infective medication use occurred in dupilumab versus placebo in asthma (24% lower; P < .0001; 95% CI 0.70-0.83) and CRSwNP patients (49% lower; P < .0001; 95% CI 0.43-0.61), and significantly fewer dupilumab-treated patients used anti-infective medications. When examined by season and month, the data indicated that investigator-reported respiratory infections and anti-infective medication use were less frequent in dupilumab- versus placebo-treated patients throughout the calendar year.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nDupilumab treatment was associated with a reduced incidence of investigator-reported respiratory infections in patients with moderate-to-severe asthma or severe CRSwNP.

They looked at how these two groups were affected by the fear of COVID-19 during the post-lockdown period. Social anxiety was measured using the Social Phobia Inventory (SPIN). Fear of COVID-19 was assessed during the post-lockdown period. The researchers found that the CBT group (n = 33) had significantly less social anxiety than the PST group (n = 32) at the end of the intervention and 14 months later, despite the COVID-related lockdown. There was no change in the PST group after the intervention, and social anxiety actually increased after lockdown. The CBT group also had significantly less fear of COVID-19 than the PST group. Social anxiety was positively correlated with fear of COVID-19. People with comorbidities (having more than one mental health disorder) had significantly more fear. Using the hierarchical multiple regression, the researchers found that the SPIN post-intervention, COVID-19 fear, and duration of SAD were the best predictors of social anxiety severity during the post-lockdown period.
